## Resource

### [CVE-2013-6632](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2013-6632.md)

- Integer overflow in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.57 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated during a Mobile Pwn2Own competition at PacSec 2013.

### [CVE-2014-1705](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2014-1705.md)

- Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.152 on OS X and Linux and before 33.0.1750.154 on Windows, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

### [CVE-2014-3176](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2014-3176.md)

- Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94 does not properly handle the interaction of extensions, IPC, the sync API, and Google V8, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-3177.

### [CVE-2014-6332](https://gist.github.com/worawit/84ab41358b8465966224)

- OleAut32.dll in OLE in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by an array-redimensioning attempt that triggers improper handling of a size value in the SafeArrayDimen function, aka "Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."

### [CVE-2014-7927](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2014-7927.md)

- The SimplifiedLowering::DoLoadBuffer function in compiler/simplified-lowering.cc in Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not properly choose an integer data type, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code.

### [CVE-2014-7928](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2014-7928.md)

- hydrogen.cc in Google V8, as used Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not properly handle arrays with holes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that triggers an array copy.

### [CVE-2015-0235](https://github.com/geekben/cve-collections/blob/master/cve20150235poc.c)

- Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST".

### [CVE-2015-0240](https://gist.github.com/worawit/051e881fc94fe4a49295)

- The Netlogon server implementation in smbd in Samba 3.5.x and 3.6.x before 3.6.25, 4.0.x before 4.0.25, 4.1.x before 4.1.17, and 4.2.x before 4.2.0rc5 performs a free operation on an uninitialized stack pointer, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Netlogon packets that use the ServerPasswordSet RPC API, as demonstrated by packets reaching the _netr_ServerPasswordSet function in rpc_server/netlogon/srv_netlog_nt.c.

### [CVE-2015-1233](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2015-1233.md)

- Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.118 does not properly handle the interaction of IPC, the Gamepad API, and Google V8, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

### [CVE-2015-1242](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/v8/CVE-2015-1242.md)

- The ReduceTransitionElementsKind function in hydrogen-check-elimination.cc in Google V8 before 4.2.77.8, as used in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that leverages "type confusion" in the check-elimination optimization.

### [CVE-2015-1635](https://gist.github.com/worawit/54f2e5a7a1a028191f76)

- HTTP.sys in Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP requests, aka "HTTP.sys Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."

### [CVE-2015-3306](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36803/)

CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).

### [CVE-2017-3881](https://github.com/artkond/cisco-rce)

- A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. This affects Catalyst switches, Embedded Service 2020 switches, Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module (CGESM) for HP, IE Industrial Ethernet switches, ME 4924-10GE switch, RF Gateway 10, and SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd48893.

### [CVE-2017-5622](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/03/26/oneplus3t-adb-charger/)

- With OxygenOS before 4.0.3, when a charger is connected to a powered-off OnePlus 3 or 3T device, the platform starts with adbd enabled. Therefore, a malicious charger or a physical attacker can open up, without authorization, an ADB session with the device, in order to further exploit other vulnerabilities and/or exfiltrate sensitive information.

### [CVE-2017-5624](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/02/08/oneplus3-bootloader-vulns/)

- An issue was discovered in OxygenOS before 4.0.3 for OnePlus 3 and 3T. The attacker can persistently make the (locked) bootloader start the platform with dm-verity disabled, by issuing the 'fastboot oem disable_dm_verity' command. Having dm-verity disabled, the kernel will not verify the system partition (and any other dm-verity protected partition), which may allow for persistent code execution and privilege escalation.

### [CVE-2017-5626](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/02/08/oneplus3-bootloader-vulns/)

- OxygenOS before version 4.0.2, on OnePlus 3 and 3T, has two hidden fastboot oem commands (4F500301 and 4F500302) that allow the attacker to lock/unlock the bootloader, disregarding the 'OEM Unlocking' checkbox, without user confirmation and without a factory reset. This allows for persistent code execution with high privileges (kernel/root) with complete access to user data.

### [CVE-2017-5638](CVE-2017-5638.md)

- The Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 mishandles file upload, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a #cmd= string in a crafted Content-Type HTTP header, as exploited in the wild in March 2017.

### [CVE-2017-5948](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/05/11/oneplus-ota/)

- An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. OxygenOS and HydrogenOS are vulnerable to downgrade attacks. This is due to a lenient 'updater-script' in OTAs that does not check that the current version is lower than or equal to the given image's. Downgrades can occur even on locked bootloaders and without triggering a factory reset, allowing for exploitation of now-patched vulnerabilities with access to user data. This vulnerability can be exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, a physical attacker can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).

### [CVE-2017-8671](https://github.com/tunz/js-vuln-db/blob/master/chakra/CVE-2017-8671.md)

- Microsoft Edge in Microsoft Windows 10 1511, 1607, 1703, and Windows Server 2016 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user due to the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory, aka "Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability". This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-8634, CVE-2017-8635, CVE-2017-8636, CVE-2017-8638, CVE-2017-8639, CVE-2017-8640, CVE-2017-8641, CVE-2017-8645, CVE-2017-8646, CVE-2017-8647, CVE-2017-8655, CVE-2017-8656, CVE-2017-8657, CVE-2017-8670, CVE-2017-8672, and CVE-2017-8674.

### [CVE-2017-8759](https://github.com/Voulnet/CVE-2017-8759-Exploit-sample)

- Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, 3.5, 3.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2 and 4.7 allow an attacker to execute code remotely via a malicious document or application, aka ".NET Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."

### [CVE-2017-8850](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/05/11/oneplus-ota/)

- An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. Due to a lenient updater-script in the OnePlus OTA images, and the fact that both ROMs use the same OTA verification keys, attackers can install HydrogenOS over OxygenOS and vice versa, even on locked bootloaders, which allows for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).

### [CVE-2017-8851](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/05/11/oneplus-ota/)

- An issue was discovered on OnePlus One and X devices. Due to a lenient updater-script on the OnePlus One and X OTA images, the fact that both products use the same OTA verification keys, and the fact that both products share the same 'ro.build.product' system property, attackers can install OTAs of one product over the other, even on locked bootloaders. That could theoretically allow for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. Moreover, the vulnerability may result in having the device unusable until a Factory Reset is performed. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA.

### [CVE-2017-8877](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/05/09/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-asus-routers/)

- ASUS RT-AC* and RT-N* devices with firmware through 3.0.0.4.380.7378 allow JSONP Information Disclosure such as the SSID.

### [CVE-2017-8878](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/05/09/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-asus-routers/)

- ASUS RT-AC* and RT-N* devices with firmware before 3.0.0.4.380.7378 allow remote authenticated users to discover the Wi-Fi password via WPS_info.xml.

### [CVE-2017-8917](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/05/sql-injection-vulnerability-joomla-3-7.html)

- SQL injection vulnerability in Joomla! 3.7.x before 3.7.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.

### [CVE-2017-9417](http://boosterok.com/blog/broadpwn2/)

- Broadcom BCM43xx Wi-Fi chips allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, aka the "Broadpwn" issue.

### [CVE-2017-9791](CVE-2017-9791.md)

- The Struts 1 plugin in Apache Struts 2.3.x might allow remote code execution via a malicious field value passed in a raw message to the ActionMessage.

### [CVE-2017-9798](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html)

- Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.

### [CVE-2017-9805](CVE-2017-9805.md)

- ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.

### [CVE-2017-9822](https://cert.360.cn/warning/detail?id=e689288863456481733e01b093c986b6)

- DNN (aka DotNetNuke) before 9.1.1 has Remote Code Execution via a cookie, aka "2017-08 (Critical) Possible remote code execution on DNN sites."

### [CVE-2017-9993](CVE-2017-9993.md)

- FFmpeg before 2.8.12, 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.9, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, and 3.3.x before 3.3.2 does not properly restrict HTTP Live Streaming filename extensions and demuxer names, which allows attackers to read arbitrary files via crafted playlist data.

### [CVE-2017-10661](http://bbs.pediy.com/thread-220490.htm)

- Race condition in fs/timerfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.15 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (list corruption or use-after-free) via simultaneous file-descriptor operations that leverage improper might_cancel queueing.

### [CVE-2017-11105](https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017026)

- The OnePlus 2 Primary Bootloader (PBL) does not validate the SBL1 partition before executing it, although it contains a certificate. This allows attackers with write access to that partition to disable signature validation.

### [CVE-2017-11421](http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/posts/gnome-thumbnailer-msi-fail.html)

- gnome-exe-thumbnailer before 0.9.5 is prone to a VBScript Injection when generating thumbnails for MSI files, aka the "Bad Taste" issue. There is a local attack if the victim uses the GNOME Files file manager, and navigates to a directory containing a .msi file with VBScript code in its filename.

### [CVE-2017-12611](CVE-2017-12611.md)

- In Apache Struts 2.0.1 through 2.3.33 and 2.5 through 2.5.10, using an unintentional expression in a Freemarker tag instead of string literals can lead to a RCE attack.

### [CVE-2017-12615](https://www.secfree.com/article-399.html)

- When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.

### [CVE-2017-1000112](https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits/tree/master/CVE-2017-1000112)

- Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch.

### [CVE-2017-1000117](http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4244.html)

- A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and an unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running "git clone --recurse-submodules" to trigger the vulnerability.

### [CVE-2017-1000353](CVE-2017-1000353.md)

- Jenkins Java Deserialization CVE-2017-1000353 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.

### [CVE-2017-1000364](Stack-Clash.md)

- An issue was discovered in the size of the stack guard page on Linux, specifically a 4k stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier (the stackguard page was introduced in 2010).

### [CVE-2017-1000365](Stack-Clash.md)

- The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take the argument and environment pointers into account, which allows attackers to bypass this limitation. This affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier. It appears that this feature was introduced in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.

### [CVE-2017-1000366](Stack-Clash.md)

- glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier.

### [CVE-2017-1000367](Stack-Clash.md)

- A vulnerability in Sudo's get_process_ttyname() for Linux: this function opens "/proc/[pid]/stat" (man proc) and reads the device number of the tty from field 7 (tty_nr). Unfortunately, these fields are space-separated and field 2 (comm, the filename of the command) can contain spaces (CVE-2017-1000367).

### [CVE-2017-1000369](Stack-Clash.md)

- Exim supports the use of multiple "-p" command line arguments which are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other issues allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This affects exim version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time upstream has released a patch (commit 65e061b76867a9ea7aeeb535341b790b90ae6c21), but it is not known if a new point release is available that addresses this issue at this time.

### [CVE-2017-1000370](Stack-Clash.md)

- The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address 0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 and earlier. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.

### [CVE-2017-1000371](Stack-Clash.md)

- The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory is allocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000 the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segment and the start of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.

### [CVE-2017-1000372](Stack-Clash.md)

- A flaw exists in OpenBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using setuid binaries such as /usr/bin/at. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.

### [CVE-2017-1000373](Stack-Clash.md)

- The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.

### [CVE-2017-1000374](Stack-Clash.md)

- A flaw exists in NetBSD's implementation of the stack guard page that allows attackers to bypass it resulting in arbitrary code execution using certain setuid binaries. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.

### [CVE-2017-1000375](Stack-Clash.md)

- NetBSD maps the run-time link-editor ld.so directly below the stack region, even if ASLR is enabled, this allows attackers to more easily manipulate memory leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.

### [CVE-2017-1000376](Stack-Clash.md)

- libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.

### [CVE-2017-1000377](Stack-Clash.md)

- An issue was discovered in the size of the default stack guard page on PAX Linux (originally from GRSecurity but shipped by other Linux vendors), specifically the default stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects PAX Linux Kernel versions as of June 19, 2017 (specific version information is not available at this time).

### [CVE-2017-1000378](Stack-Clash.md)

- The NetBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.

### [CVE-2017-1000379](Stack-Clash.md)

- The Linux Kernel running on AMD64 systems will sometimes map the contents of PIE executable, the heap or ld.so to where the stack is mapped allowing attackers to more easily manipulate the stack. Linux Kernel version 4.11.5 is affected.
